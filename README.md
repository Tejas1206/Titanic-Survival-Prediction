# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset that includes various features such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare, the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not.
